# Saibapp: Saibai Saftey App

### Project Overview

The Saibai Safety app is designed to address the inefficiencies in Saibai Island's existing early warning system for natural disasters such as storms and fires. By providing timely alerts and crucial information directly to residents' smartphones, the app aims to improve disaster preparedness and reduce the risks associated with these events.
